        <p>
            I am the author of more than a dozen books, 
            most notably two unique explorations of digital computing:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><i><a href="/books#code">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a></i></li>

            <li><i><a href="/books#annotated-turing">The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine</a></i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I grew up in New Jersey and attended Stevens Institute of Technology. 
            After graduating in 1975 with a BS and MS in mathematics, I moved to New York City and worked 10 years for a major insurance company.
            Although not an actuary, I did actuarial work and PL/I programming for individual health insurance product development.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1977 I began exploring how I could build electronic music instruments.
            This led to a self-taught education in digital electronics, 
                and (within a couple years) to designing and building a digital electronic music synthesizer controlled by a homebrew computer based around the Zilog Z80 microprocessor.  
            This project is documented in <a href="https://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/AdventuresInElectronicMusic/">"Adventures in Electronic Music: Beeps, Bloops, and Klangs: 1974â€“1982"</a>.
            I later used much of the knowledge and experience I gained from this project to write my book <i>Code</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I acquired my first IBM PC in early 1984 and began writing for <i>PC Magazine</i> that same year.
            This led to a full-time freelance career that included writing for <i>Microsoft Systems Journal</i> and <i>MSDN</i> magazines.
            My book <i>Programming Windows</i> was published in six editions between 1988 and 2012, 
            and I also wrote books on OS/2, Windows Forms, the Windows Presentation Foundation, the C# programming language, and Windows Phone. 
            In 2014 I began working as a full-time employee for Xamarin (which was acquired in 2016 by Microsoft), where I wrote a book and documentation about Xamarin.Forms.
            In 2018 I retired from my 34-year-career of writing, speaking, and thinking about 
            programming and APIs. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of my old books are accessible from the <a href="/books#out-of-print-books">Books</a> page 
            of this website. 
            If you're looking for links to some of my old <i>MSDN</i> articles or other stuff,
            you might find them on my <a href="/home.html">old website</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout the year 2020 I celebrated the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of Beethoven with daily tweets of YouTube videos of all of Beethoven's music in chronological order.
            These tweets have been collected and organized in the website <a href="https://www.completebeethoven.com">The Complete Beethoven</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since 2007 I have been married to author, activist, and historian <a href="https://www.deirdresinnott.com/">Deirdre Sinnott</a>, whose first novel, <a href="http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/the-third-mrs-galway/"><i>The Third Mrs. Galway</i></a>, set in Utica, New York in 1835, was published by Akashic Books in 2021. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently working on what I hope to be a series of books on the historical, social, political, and philosophical foundations of computing. 
            Tentative titles are:
        </p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><i>The Lost Art of Logarithms</i> (<a href="https://www.LostArtOfLogarithms.com">in progress</a>)</li>

            <li><i>The Mathematics of Miracles: David Hume, Charles Babbage and the Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</i></li>

            <li><i>Computer of the Tides: Lord Kelvin's Machine to Disprove Evolution</i></li> 

            <li><i>Silk and Software: The Story of the Jacquard Loom</i> (but this one now seems unlikely considering that much of the research would require that I read French)</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            Wish me luck.
        </p>
